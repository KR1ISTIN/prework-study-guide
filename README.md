# Prework Study Guide

## HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for my UTSA Full Stack bootcamp course. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation behind this project was to use these notes so I can all reference back when I need to. Building this project allowed me to get a better understand of how HTML, CSS, GIT, and JS all go together with a hands on experience rather than watching videos and taking notes. I was able to learn peicing together HTML, CSS, and JS and using Git to bring everything together in my Repo.
